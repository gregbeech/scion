# Xenon 

[![Gem Version][fury-badge]][fury] [![Build Status][travis-badge]][travis] [![Code Climate][cc-badge]][cc]

An HTTP framework for building RESTful APIs, inspired by [Spray][spray].

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'xenon'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install xenon

## Usage

At the moment I probably wouldn't use this gem for anything you actually depend on because it's _very_ early in its lifecycle. However, feel free to have a play around, raise bugs, and contribute if you're interested.

## Contributing

1. Fork it ( https://github.com/[my-github-username]/xenon/fork )
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
